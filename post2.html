        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>With Earth Day quickly approaching, there's no better time than right now to head over to The Story of
            Stuff Project's (TSSP) website at: <a href="https://www.storyofstuff.org/">www.storyofstuff.org</a> for
            inspiration on how we can all pitch in
            to support environmental protection. The Story of Stuff Project is a nonprofit organization with the mission
            to tell stories and inspire action in "how our Stuff is extracted, produced, distributed, consumed, and
            disposed of."</p>

          <a>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-home.jpg" alt="the story of stuff home page">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Us Homepage</span>

          <p>In addition to fostering my appreciation for what the folks at The Story of Stuff Project are up to, I also
            wanted to analyze the website for its usable design. The principles for a well designed site are based on a
            wide range of sources.</p>

          <p>For this post, I will base my observations on the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What is this site?</li>
            <li>Why should I be here?</li>
            <li>What page am I on?</li>
            <li>How can I search?</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- 1. What is this site? -->
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is this site?</h2>
          <p>As soon as people enter a site, it needs to be clear what that site is and what it's for.</p>
          <h3>Site ID</h3>
          <p>One way to let people know where they are is with the Site ID or logo. TSSP's logo is placed in the middle
            of the primary navigation across the top of the page, which falls in line with where most people expect to
            see it.</p>
          <a>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-id.jpg" alt="the story of stuff site identity and logo">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Stuff Project Site ID</span>

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>Right off the bat, it's not immediately clear what the purpose of the site is. Scroll down a little though
            and you can see that TSSP makes "movies that make a difference". Still not 100% clear with that observation
            alone but scroll a little further and you can see a few posts titled <a
              href="http://action.storyofstuff.org/survey/changemaker-quiz/">What Type of Changemaker Are You?</a> and
            <a href="https://www.storyofstuff.org/plastic/">Join the Fight to End Plastic Pollution</a>.</p>
          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-site-identity.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Stuff Project "We Make Movies That Make a Difference".</span>

          <h3>What Works and What Doesn't</h3>
          <p>With the Site ID and the post content on the homepage, I think TSSP does a really good job at letting
            people know what the site is and what it's about. Without immediately heading over to the About page, it
            only takes a few seconds to get an idea of what TSSP's mission is. That being said, it could be even easier
            though. Many websites include a tagline right next to the Site ID. A tagline can quickly get a message
            across to convey what the site is about.</p>

          <!-- 2. Why should I be here? -->
          <h2 class="section-heading">Why should I be here?</h2>
          <p>The site's purpose should give people a reason to be there, address their needs and be relevant to what
            they're doing. On Earth Day this year, April 22nd, TSSP is televising their documentary on plastic
            pollution, <i>The Story of Plastic</i>. My purpose for visiting the site was to find details on where and
            when I can watch it. In that context, I found the content on the site to be extremely useful and valuable.
          </p>

          <a>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-why.jpg"
              alt="the story of stuff 'we make movies that make a difference' video thumbnails">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Stuff Project "We Make Movies that Make a Difference"</span>

          <h3>What Works and What Doesn't</h3>
          <p>With the upcoming release of <i>The Story of Plastic</i>, it's probably safe to say that TSSP made the
            right call in anticipating that more people would visit the site and thus, dedicated a lot of real estate to
            highlight the film. My only real issue with finding the viewing details was that I had to click around a few
            times and almost overlooked it because the details weren't very visually obvious. Formatting this to support
            skimming would have been nice.</p>

          <!-- 3. What page am I on?-->
          <h2 class="section-heading">What page am I on?</h2>
          <p>A well designed navigation can allow people to find what they're looking for without needless clicks. </p>

          <h3>Navigating the Site</h3>
          <p>Understanding how to navigate the TSSP site is really easy. The headings and subheadings are grouped
            appropriately. Clicking on a subheading opens a new page and the clear bold page names make it obvious where
            you are on the site. </p>

          <a>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-page-identity.jpg"
              alt="the story of stuff homepage, learn more dropdown menu">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Stuff Project Site Identity</span>
          <p></p>

          <h3>What Works and What Doesn't</h3>
          <p>I found that the bright colors and bold sizing of the headings, subheadings, and page names really made
            them stand out. It was easy to find my way around the site initially but as I veered further away from the
            main content, I found that I could easily lose my bearings. The site doesn't make use of breadcrumbs to show
            hierarchy so if I wanted to go back a few pages, I would have to click the back button. The navigation also
            doesn't show more than the secondary level of subheadings so unless I find what I'm looking for there, I'd
            have to do some clicking around.</p>

          <!-- 4. How can I search? -->
          <h2 class="section-heading">How can I search?</h2>
          <p>Many people will look for a search box as soon as they enter a site. It's usually a simple box with a
            button and can either have the word "search" next to it or a little magnifying glass icon. The search
            feature was not an option on the TSSP site.</p>

          <a>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/story-of-stuff-search.jpg" alt="the story of stuff homepage missing search box">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Story of Stuff Project</span>

          <h3>What Works and What Doesn't</h3>
          <p>The website did a lot of things right but not having a search box can be quite inconvenient. Eventually,
            people will leave if they can't find what they're looking for. If I could only make one suggestion for this
            site, it would be to add a search function.</p>
