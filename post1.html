  <!-- Post Content -->
  <article>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>I stumbled upon the <a href="http://library.nyam.org/colorourcollections/">#ColorOurCollections</a> page
            as I was browsing <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/you-and-your-family#facemasks">Washington State's
              Coronavirus Response site</a> for information on facemasks. It was linked as a resource to help support
            children at home during the school closures.</p>

          <p><a href="http://library.nyam.org/colorourcollections/">#ColorOurCollections</a>, launched by The New York
            Academy of Medicine (NYAM), is an annual coloring festival hosted on social media. The event brings together
            institutions from around the world and allows participants free access to coloring content. Coloring books
            remain accessible year-round on NYAM's website.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/color-our-collections-main.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">#ColorOurCollections page launched by The New York Academy of Medicine</span>

          <p>I thought this would make a good site to analyze for usability and decided to base my results on the
            following criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ease of Use</li>
            <li>Information Facilitation</li>
            <li>Look & Feel Appeal</li>
            <li>Site Organization</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Ease of Use</h2>

          <p>I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first accessed the page but I knew I was looking for coloring
            content. From the homepage, it wasn't inherently clear where the coloring pages where but after some
            clicking around, I quickly realized that each of the post containers held a link to a coloring book. The
            image in each of the posts provided a preview of what to expect from the coloring book.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/west-virginia-regional-coloring-book.JPG" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">West Virginia and Regional History Center Coloring Book 2020 post</span>

          <p>Clicking on the link opened up the page to the collection where the full coloring book could be viewed,
            downloaded or printed. Overall, I found the website to be very user-friendly. There wasn't much effort
            expended in thinking about what was what and how to use it.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Information Facilitation</h2>

          <p>With information facilitation, I wanted to see how quickly I could find information. I decided to do a
            search for cats to see if I could find anything for a cat-loving kid. The search results brought up 4 pages
            of content, which seemed promising, but upon further inspection, many of the results included collections
            that simply had the word "cat" somewhere in them, such as: "Yucatan", "Education", "Cataloging",
            "Dedicated" and many other "cat" words. </p>



          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/yucatan.jpg" alt="Yucatan Coloring Pages">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Yucatan coloring pages.</span>

          <p>I ran a search for a few other keywords including "kitten" but wasn't able to find any cat related content.
            A quick search for "New York" content, on the other hand, procured a number of coloring pages though. I felt
            that information facilitation was fine overall. My unsuccessful cat search is likely due to the fact that
            this site is geared more towards educational and historical art, not kittens.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Look & Feel Appeal</h2>

          <p>The look and feel of the page seems to work well, however, the dropdown on the navigation menu could be
            viewed poorly in accessibility terms. There isn't much setting it apart from the content below so this could
            make it difficult for some users to see. </p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/color-our-collections-nav-dropdown.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Navigation dropdown options were difficult to differentiate from other page
            content.</span>

          <p>I would suggest using contrasting colors here to provide a clear separation between the navigation bar,
            dropdown menu, and the main content, which are all similarly colored at the moment.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Site Organization</h2>

          <p>The organization of the site was self-evident after a teeny bit of thought. Since the page is mainly focused on providing coloring content to visitors, it's probably safe to say that a lot of time is spent in the coloring collections section. This was easy to find once I made the connection between "Participating Institutions" and "coloring books".</p>
